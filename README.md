 **# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning**

**## Overview**

This repository contains the code and resources for a project that aims to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict heart disease based on patient data, potentially aiding in early diagnosis and prevention.

**## Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 303 records of patients, each with 14 attributes, including:

* Age
* Sex
* Chest pain type
* Resting blood pressure
* Serum cholesterol
* Fasting blood sugar
* Resting ECG results
* Maximum heart rate achieved
* Exercise induced angina
* ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
* Thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
* Diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)

**## Getting Started**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/heart-disease-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the dataset and notebooks to understand the data and the modeling process.
4. Run the notebooks to reproduce the results.
5. Customize the code for your own experiments and model development.
